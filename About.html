        <p id="p_about">Welcome to the Mathematics Society at University of Kelaniya, where our passion for mathematics has been a cornerstone of academic excellence since the inception of the university in 1959. Our journey, deeply rooted in the pursuit of mathematical knowledge, has evolved over the decades, and we are proud to share our story with you.

            The Mathematics Society traces its origins to the earliest days of the university when we began imparting the fundamental principles of mathematics to students within the Faculty of Arts. In 1967, as the Faculty of Science was established, the Department of Mathematics took its formal place within the academic landscape. Since then, we have been dedicated to educating and inspiring students in the realms of both Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, offering these subjects as part of the Bachelor of Science (General) degree program.
            
            As we continued to grow, we introduced the Special Degree Program, allowing students to delve deeper into their mathematical interests through specialized streams, such as Pure Mathematics & Applied Mathematics and Pure Mathematics & Statistics.</p>
        <p id="p_about">
            In 2005, we proudly collaborated with the Department of Physics to pioneer a unique offering: the Special Degree Program in Mathematical Physics. This program, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, exemplifies our commitment to fostering interdisciplinary excellence in mathematics.
            
            At the Department of Mathematics, we not only focus on academic instruction but also encourage and support research endeavors. Our students have the opportunity to engage in profound exploration in fields such as Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics, and Mathematical Physics, ultimately leading to the attainment of M. Phil. and Ph.D. degrees.
            
            Beyond our academic pursuits, we take great pride in our commitment to serving the broader community. Our faculty members actively contribute their expertise to national institutions related to education, playing a pivotal role in shaping the curricula for G.C.E. (A/L) and G. C. E. (O/L) examinations. We are equally dedicated to enhancing mathematics education at the middle and upper school levels.
            
            Our dedication extends to nurturing the next generation of educators. 
        </p>
        <p id="p_about">
            We actively support training programs for mathematics teachers in secondary schools, empowering them to inspire and educate future mathematicians.
            
            Furthermore, our department has forged valuable international connections. We engage in close research collaborations with esteemed mathematicians at Kyushu University in Japan, fostering a global perspective in our pursuit of mathematical knowledge.
            
            As we celebrate our rich history and look forward to an even brighter future, the Mathematics Society at [University Name] welcomes all students, faculty, and enthusiasts to join us in our mathematical journey. Whether you're passionate about Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics, or Mathematical Physics, you'll find a vibrant community here that shares your love for mathematics and a commitment to excellence. Together, we will continue to explore the limitless possibilities that mathematics offers and contribute to the ever-expanding world of mathematical knowledge.
